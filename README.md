# GeoVec-VE: Reproducible Experiments on Visual Exploration Framework of Geospatial Vector Big Data

## Introduction
This work is a companion reproducibility paper that presents a framework to reproduce our previous experiments and results reported in [1]. In that previous paper, we proposed an efficient visual exploration approach of geospatial vector big data on the web map, which designs the display-driven visualization model and combines the traditional data-driven visualization model to realize the interactive real-time map visualization. Due to the lack of reproducible and extensible implementations of methods, our work introduces a comprehensive reproducibility framework to publicly release our source code, datasets, runtime environment, experiments, and software tools. We provide detailed reproducibility protocols for both the experiments and the software tool. After downloading the dataset and deploying the environment setups, the primary work can be successfully reproduced, and the on-site visual exploration for user-provided datasets on the web map can be demonstrated by running a series of execution scripts of the experiments and the software tool. The reproducibility protocol can be created and tested in both Ubuntu machines and Docker containers. Moreover, we introduce and discuss new experimental results by running the reproducibility protocol introduced herein, our work can be considered weakly reproducible, since we were able to validate the ability of our work to interact in real-time and outperform the existing methods, leading us to the same conclusions.
